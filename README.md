# Project 7
## Add responsive web design for tablets and wide screens & Add styling for print

**You are expected to thoroughly review the materials in Module Week 10 as well as Module Week 6. You must use our CSS formatting rules from the CISY 225 Style Guide when writing your CSS. You are also required to use Beautify inside of Brackets. I encourage you to beautify often as you write code for your HTML and CSS.**


**You Must Have a Perfect Project 6 Repo. Make all changes to P6 before starting this project. Your grade depends on this. If you need help, ask me for help.**

In this project you are using the design document as shown in 

[Adobe XD RWD of About Me](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a5db66b4-3086-4f9b-4c62-b0ecce091949-d3ea/ "Adobe XD RWD of ABout Me")

You will be adding media queries and CSS grids to get your About Me page looking similar to the design images.

0. Use Project 6 as your starter code.
1. Make room at the bottom of your styles.css file to add new styling.
2. Add the following shell code.

````
/*  grids */

main {
	display: grid;
}

/* hero content */

.content {
	display: grid;
}

/* about content */

.about-content {
	display: grid;
}

/*  gallery */

.gallery {
	display: grid;
}

/*  article */

article {
	display: grid;
}

/* form container */
.form-container {
	display: grid;
}

/* footer */

footer {
	display: grid;
}

/*  layout */

@media screen and (min-width: 48rem) {
